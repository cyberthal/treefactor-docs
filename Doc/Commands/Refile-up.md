% refile-up

tro-refile-up refiles something up one directory level.

It refiles text lines, outline headings and files.

Text goes into Inbox.org, and files go into /0-Inbox.

Here's a demo gif:

What you just saw:

The stuff in the /Demo/Basement directory was all refiled up. tro-refile-up did slightly different things depending on context.

The Org heading named "Beam me up, Scotty" in /Demo/Basement/Elevator-car.org didn't belong in that file. It was refiled up to Demo/Inbox.org

Then Elevator-car.org was refiled up to Demo/0-Inbox/

The file Frog-legs.org was already inside a /0-Inbox directory, so it jumped a little higher, but landed in the same place: from Demo/Basement/0-Inbox to Demo/0-Inbox
