% "tro-" prefix meaning explained

Firstly, "tro-" is easy to type. The purpose of the package is speed.

Secondly, The Treefactor workflow is loosely based on [Brainstorm](http://brainstormsw.com), a proprietary Windows application about as old as Emacs.

In Brainstorm, moving text was called a "throw", because one throws text to a location. In both Brainstorm and Treefactor, moving text is more like packing a house in order to move. You throw your screwdrivers into the "garage" box, and later at the destination you unpack the box and put the screwdrivers in their final destination. The act of throwing the screwdrivers into the "garage" box is an imprecise incomplete refiling.

In traditional refiling, the item goes directly to its final destination. This is like putting pieces of paper into a filing cabinet full of folders. If you miss, it gets lost. For example, if you put your dishwasher warranty into your Medical folder, you aren't likely to find it again.

When moving things with Treefactor, you usually don't see exactly where they end up. For example, when refiling to a file, you don't see the parent heading. When refiling to an outline, you don't see the adjacent child headings. This is similar to throwing an object into a box.

Imprecise refiles are handy because they require less thought. You don't need to know anything more than the information currently on the screen in order to "throw" the object in the right general direction. You don't need to know the exact layout of your new house in order to put stuff in the "garage" box.

An accumulation of imprecise refiles eventually results in precise refiling, without the usual accompanying mental friction of one-step precise refiling. The correct meta-outline structure is discovered inductively and experimentally rather than deductively and theoretically. By becoming protean, the meta outline need only meet the priorities of the present, because it can evolve in response to future needs.

In short, streamlining meta-outline evolution permits a 10x greater daily text processing capacity. If we extend the biological metaphor, this marks the end of an era in personal information management.

So why not use the term "throw" instead of "refile", if it fits better?

Because everybody already knows that "refile" means moving text and files.

By contrast, the word "throw" has a pre-existing conflicting Emacs meaning - "throw" is a built-in function in Emacs' C source code. In general "throw" is coder jargon for an unrelated concept.

So we can't use the term "throw", even though it's intuitive for non-coders. However, keeping an echo around in the phonetic misspelling "tro" can't hurt. If anything, the misspelling is a reminder of just how simple and dumb Treefactor's basic operation is. That's not a bad thing. Even supercomputers are built out of 1s and 0s.

tro-refile(-up) is the easiest way to impart the human intelligence to a computer that it inherently lacks. It tells the computer: "This text doesn't belong here, it goes thataway." Repeating this instruction at scale makes the meta-outline a synchronized exobrain - a Textmind.
